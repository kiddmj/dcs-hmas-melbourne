==========================================================
GENERAL NOTES:

There are 3 variants:
- HMAS Melbourne (Fixed Wing) - Version for all carrier-based aircraft types with
	a collision model extension from the bow and 85m cat length to allow almost any aircraft to
	launch from the catapult.
	Should work well with the FA/18C, F-14, A-4E-C, AV-8BNA, any helicopter, and any
	aircraft carrier capable aircraft in the future.
	Helipads only align with the default yellow deck markings livery.
- HMAS Melbourne (Fixed Wing [WIP]) - Version with real world cat length of 43m.
	Will land all types above, and the AI doesn't seem to have issues launching aircraft either.
	Can catapult launch the Hornet and Tomcat to varying degrees and weights.
	Have a doctor on standby for the concussion of launch. The A-4E-C will generally knock the pilot out
	and dive into the sea.
	The catapult dynamics of either the ship or aircraft in DCS was not designed with short catapults
	in mind.  Aircraft with long legs and high centres of gravity on the catapult tend to rear up
	and bounce (sometimes destructively) down the catapult.**
	This is the one I will keep working on to get the cat working at it's native length.
- Majestic Class (STOVL) - ASW/LPH ship with no catapult, bridle arrestor, or landing arrestor gear.
	For emulation of HMS Bulwark, Warrior, Ocean, etc. or other Majestic or Colossus class ships converted
	to ASW/LPH platforms.  Helipads only align with the HMAS Sydney livery.
	The HMAS Sydney livery (the default) is a fictional upgrade to the real HMAS Sydney as an ASW/LPH
	carrier.  In real life, after a short period of fixed wing operations, she was converted to
	a transport carrier.

The HMAS Melbourne is small, especially if you are used to Nimitz class carriers.  Her entire length fits
 on the just the flight deck portion of the USS Nimitz.
The horizontal distance on approach from the round-down on the stern to the arrestor wires is much shorter
 than on Nimitz class carriers, as is the entire ship.  As such, the vertical clearance over the stern on the
 glideslope is small.  If you are more than a little low on the final approach you will hit it with sudden
 and unflattering results.
On "HMAS Melbourne (Fixed Wing)", the bow chock has a collision mesh. If taking off in an AV-8B,
 avoid clipping it with your wheels or you will lose them.

To connect to the catapult, lower the draw bar of Hornet and Tomcat a few meters before the shuttle (for
 example, when the aircraft nose is over the shuttle).  The A-4E-C has this permanently down in code
 so there is no need to lower the drawbar on that aircraft.
 Taxi forward slowly until the nose wheel(s) are on the rear of the shuttle.
 Release the brakes and quickly use the catapult hook-up command of the aircraft in question to hook
 onto the catapult.  The exact position where the hook-up takes place varies from aircraft to aircraft.
 Launch using the commands that your aircraft would use on any other carrier (usu. Shift+U or 100% Throttle).
 
SUGGESTED Additional Mods:
Battle group configuration for RAN service
- The A-4E-C Skyhawk, but don't use the included Australian skins, download these:
    https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/files/3309474/
- HMAS Vampire (D11)/HMAS Vendetta (D08) - Modified Daring class destroyers
	https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/files/3313017/
- The Oliver Hazard Perry Guided Missile Frigate.
	Included with DCS, this was the basis in slightly modified form for the
	Adelaide Class firgates of the RAN.

==========================================================

Upon landing, the AI will taxi to the starboard side of the bow and park 4x A-4E-C, 3x FA/18 Hornets,
 or 2x F-14 Tomcats.

The 40mm Bofors defences all function.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- The A-4E-C Skyhawk v1.4.x and earlier will have issues with freezing on deck/off the catapult,
	and not detecting that you are on a carrier when trying to hook up to the catapult.
	This is a Simple Flight Model issue generally.  Don't use it, use the A-4E-C EFM v2.0+ version instead.
- There is an invisible collision mesh aft of helipad 6, ahead of the round-down where the aircraft will
	rebound from if taxi'd into slowly, and damage the aircraft if taxi'd into with vigour or repeatedly.
	Try not to taxi	aft	of helipad 6 until this is resolved. There is nothing in the collision model at
	that location, so the reason for it is currently a mystery.
- I have had one report of the A-4E-C EFM Beta 2 flipping over on landing with the tailhook interaction
	with the deck, but have been unable to recreate this myself or with other testers.  If the tail hook
	interacts with what causes the condition above behind helipad 6, this might cause it, but you would
	need to be very low on the glideslope or touching down short for this to be a factor.
- The clearance of the F-14 on the catapult with the Jet Blast Deflector is tight.  The afterburner
	effect pays it no heed, and passes straight through it.
- iFOLS is uncalibrated.  I have no frame of reference for it from other carriers.
	If anyone would like to calibrate it and give feedback I won't mind at all.
	It is all in the LUA code, not the model, so a text editor is all that is required to make changes,
	we just need to know what those changes are.
- There is no damage model, but there are damage zones, and fire will start in these if damaged enough.
	The Damage values are uncalibrated, so YMMV on sinking her.

This remains a work in progress, and should be considered late alpha state of completion.

Constructive suggestions and bug reporting encouraged, "rivet counters" need not apply.  I will fix issues as I get time.
Updates and improvements will follow as I have the time and motivation/inspiration, as I learn new skills,
 and as DCS evolves.  In that order.
 
Thanks go to @CrazyEddie, @Joey45, @Admiral189 & @Hawkeye60 for their guidance, assistance, and asset contributions.
Thanks go out to @mmarques for lua fixes and @HellesBelle for testing and quantifying some issues with the arrestors.
Also thanks go to and a couple of my mates who put up with the endless new downoads I give them.

**  The catapult attachment to the aircraft does not hold the launch bar in position near the deck, only in
 the line of the catapult, so vertical movement of the nose wheel is not constrained.  This leaves some
 aircraft free to rear up and bounce down the catapult.  A short catapult out of necessity accelerates the
 aircraft to flying speed faster.  This can have undesirable effects on the pilot, presumably caused
 by the physics around the coupling of the centre of gravity and low centre of the application of thrust/drag
 forces from the catapult.
The higher the centre of gravity (and thus the point that inertial mass acts upon), the further away is it is
 from the application of the catapult thrust on the deck.  This creates a turning moment that causes the aircraft
 to rotate tail down (and thus nose up).  Then gravity takes hold and pulls the nose down again -> "rinse, lather, repeat".
